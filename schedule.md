# Schedule for the summer

**Week 1 (Jun 30)**

learn you a haskell, chapters 5-9

Try writing your own version of the following functions: `elem`, `words`, `zip`, `map`, `filter`, `foldr`.  You can find more info about these functions by searching on "hoogle": http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=elem.  If multiple functions of the same name are listed, you want the function in the Prelude module.

**Week 2 (July 7)**

learn you a haskell, chapters 10-14

**Week 3 (July 14)**

real world haskell, chapters 8-11

**Week 4 (July 21)**

begin webpage development

**Week 5 (July 28)**

get working prototype

**Week 6 (Aug 4)**

add gamification features

**Week 7 (Aug 11)**

begin blog posts

**Week 8 (Aug 18)**

practice webpage launch, debugging

**Week 9 (Aug 25)**

full launch webpage

## What you'll get paid for

Every blog post you write will get you $50.  If the blog post gets 1000 readers, you'll get an extra $50.  If 5000 readers, another extra $50.  If 15000 readers, another extra $50.

Blog posts should be between 500-2000 words.  They'll be on some coding topic you found interesting while working on this project.  Good ideas are comparisons between C++ and Haskell.

For example:

1.  Compare the error messages between C++ and Haskell.   Which one is easier to figure out?
2.  Compare two libraries that do similar features between C++ and Haskell.
3.  Which language makes it easier to download and install new libraries?
4.  What are your favorite features of Haskell you wish were available in C++ (and vice versa).
5.  Was working on a project an effective way to learn a new language?
6.  Implement a data structure in both C++ and Haskell and see which one is better?
